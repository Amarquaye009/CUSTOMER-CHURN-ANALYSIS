## CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) Methodology Application 
The CRISP-DM framework is a widely adopted methodology for data mining projects, providing a structured approach to planning and executing data analysis tasks. It comprises six major phases, each with its own set of tasks and deliverables, ensuring a comprehensive and iterative process.

The six(6) phases are;
 1. Business Understanding which focuses on understanding the objectives and requirements of the project.

 2. Data understanding  which drives the focus to identify, collect, and analyze the data sets that can help you accomplish the project goals.

 3. Data preparation which prepares the final datasets for modeling.

 4. Modeling to build and assess various models based on several differnt modeling techniques.

 5. Evaluation - To evaluate results and review process and determine the next steps.

 6. Deployment - To deploy the results can be as simple as generating a report or any requirement given.

## PROJECT TITLE

CHURN PREDICTION AND ANALYSIS : Leveraging Machine Learning for Customer Retention

## OBJECTIVE

Team aims to analyze the various factors influencing clients' decisions to churn and predict future churn probability by leveraging machine learning techniques.

## GOAL
To develop predictive models that forecast the likelihood of individual customers churning in the future, enabling proactive intervention strategies to retain at-risk customers and maximize customer retention

# 2. Data Understanding:

Data Sources:

This project utilizes two primary datasets sourced from different platforms:

The first dataset originates from an SQL database and the second dataset is sourced from a GitHub repository.

The columns in both datasets include :

1. Customer_ID
2. Gender
3. Senior_Citizen
4. Partner
5. Dependents
6. Tenure_Months
7. Phone_Service
8. Multiple_Lines
9. Internet_Service
10. Online_Security
11. Online_Backup
12. Device_Protection
13. Tech_Support
14. Streaming_TV
15. Streaming_Movies
16. Contract
17. Paperless_Billing
18. Payment_Method
19. Monthly_Charges
20. Total_Charges
21. Churn

## Objective
Machine learning  model to analyse customer churn.By designing this model we will be able to asses the customer charn rate. with the ouput results  from the model we will be able comeup with strategies for customer retension hence increse revenue.


## Goal
Designing  a machine learning model to analyse customer churn using 3 datasets. The first 2 datasets are for training and evaluation while the 3rd  dataset  will be used for testing the model.


# 2. Data Understanding
Data sources-the datasets in question for the annalysis were sourced  from diffent sources. The first dataset been drawn from a database and the other 2 from a csv file and onedrive respectively.

The columns include in the datasets were as follows;
CustomerID
Gender
Senior citizen
Partner
Dependent
Tenure
Phone service
Multiple lines
internet service 
onlinesecurity
Device protection
Tech support
Streaming tv
Streaming movies 
Contract
Paperless billing
Payment method
monthly charges
Total charges
