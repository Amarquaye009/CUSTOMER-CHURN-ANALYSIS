## CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) Methodology Application 
The CRISP-DM framework is a widely adopted methodology for data mining projects, providing a structured approach to planning and executing data analysis tasks. It comprises six major phases, each with its own set of tasks and deliverables, ensuring a comprehensive and iterative process.

The six(6) phases are;
 1. Business Understanding which focuses on understanding the objectives and requirements of the project.

 2. Data understanding  which drives the focus to identify, collect, and analyze the data sets that can help you accomplish the project goals.

 3. Data preparation which prepares the final datasets for modeling.

 4. Modeling to build and assess various models based on several differnt modeling techniques.

 5. Evaluation - To evaluate results and review process and determine the next steps.

 6. Deployment - To deploy the results can be as simple as generating a report or any requirement given.
 
 
 # 1. Business Understanding

## Project Title
CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS

## Objective
Machine learning  model to analyse customer churn.By designing this model we will be able to asses the customer charn rate. with the ouput results  from the model we will be able comeup with strategies for customer retension hence increse revenue.


## Goal
Designing  a machine learning model to analyse customer churn using 3 datasets. The first 2 datasets are for training and evaluation while the 3rd  dataset  will be used for testing the model.


# 2. Data Understanding
Data sources-the datasets in question for the annalysis were sourced  from diffent sources. The first dataset been drawn from a database and the other 2 from a csv file and onedrive respectively.

The columns include in the datasets were as follows;
CustomerID
Gender
Senior citizen
Partner
Dependent
Tenure
Phone service
Multiple lines
