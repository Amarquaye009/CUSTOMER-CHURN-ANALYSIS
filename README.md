# CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSIS -- Team Fiji

##  CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) Methodology Application 

The CRISP-DM framework is a widely adopted methodology for data mining projects, providing a structured approach to planning and executing data analysis tasks. It comprises six major phases, each with its own set of tasks and deliverables, ensuring a comprehensive and iterative process.

The six(6) phases are;
 1. Business Understanding which focuses on understanding the objectives and requirements of the project.

 2. Data understanding  which drives the focus to identify, collect, and analyze the data sets that can help you accomplish the project goals.

 3. Data preparation which prepares the final datasets for modeling.

 4. Modeling to build and assess various models based on several differnt modeling techniques.

 5. Evaluation - To evaluate results and review process and determine the next steps.

 6. Deployment - To deploy the results can be as simple as generating a report or any requirement given.
